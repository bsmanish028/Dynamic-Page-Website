# Dynamic-Page-Website

- This Website is made by using technology :
- 1.HTML
- 2.CSS
- 3.JavaScript
- 4.PHP

- I have worked on GET and POST super global variable only in this project.
- By using this GET, I have created page navigation with proper url encoding and 
- When user type wrong keyword(query) they show and defined Not Found Page.
- and In the Contact Us section user can send mail also by using local.(my repo : form-validation-with-php).
